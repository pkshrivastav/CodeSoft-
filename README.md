# NUMBER-GAME (Numg)
Description
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game randomly selects a number within a specified range (1 to 100), and the player has to guess the correct number. Feedback is given on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and there is a limit to the number of attempts allowed per round. Players can play multiple rounds, and their score is based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

Features
Random number generation within a specified range (1 to 100).
User inputs their guess.
Feedback provided on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
Limited number of attempts per round.
Option to play multiple rounds.
Display of score based on attempts or rounds won.
How to Play
The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the game will tell the player if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
After each round, the player can choose to play again or exit.
The score is displayed at the end of each round, based on the number of attempts or rounds won.
